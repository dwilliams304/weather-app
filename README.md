This is a simple weather app that will give you the details of a city's weather after submitting.

## Setup
If you'd like to copy this do the following:

1. Go to https://www.weatherapi.com/ to sign up for a free account
2. Copy your API key after creating an account
3. In the project, navigate to src/constants/index.js
4. In the API_KEY field put the API key you just copied

Then of course just do:

```

>npm run dev
```

And your project will be running and working!
Make any updates you please.
